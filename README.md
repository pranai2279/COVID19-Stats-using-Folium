I am delighted to share on data visualization but this time it is based on COVID-19 stats over India. I implemented it using a dataset provided in Kaggle and using the Folium library.
Folium is good to use with geographical data and manipulate it using latitudes and longitudes.
Here you can find stats related to covid19 like total confirmed cases, deaths, cured/discharged cases in India(country-wise) as per 12/6/2020.
